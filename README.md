## Introduction
The object of the puzzle is to find 75% of the words the computer found
in a 4x4 grid of letters using Boggle rules.  Untimed -- take as long
as you need.  Improve your skill by keeping at it until you find (at
least) 75% of what the computer found.  The wordlist is intended to be
a college-educated common vocabulary of US English, not arcane, archaic,
or esoteric words.
